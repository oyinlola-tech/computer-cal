# ⚛️ Quantum Scientific Calculator - Futuristic 3D Web App

Welcome to the **Quantum Scientific Calculator**, a next-generation, 3D-rendered scientific calculator built for web. This project is designed to push the boundaries of what a calculator app can look and feel like, combining **mathematical precision** with **immersive visual design** using cutting-edge web technologies like **Three.js**, **Math.js**, and **GSAP**.

This calculator supports both **mouse/touch interaction** and **keyboard input**, featuring animations, glowing 3D buttons, and a sleek sci-fi interface that works beautifully across modern desktop browsers.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Advanced Scientific Functions**  
  Trigonometric (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`), logarithmic (`log`, `ln`), roots, powers, reciprocals, factorials, and constants like `π` and `e`.

- ✅ **3D Interactive Interface**  
  Built with `Three.js`, the calculator is fully rendered in 3D with animated buttons and realistic lighting.

- ✅ **Futuristic Glassmorphic UI**  
  The digital display uses a translucent, glowing UI panel with soft shadows and neon text.

- ✅ **Math Engine Powered by Math.js**  
  All calculations are handled using `Math.js` for accuracy and extensibility.

- ✅ **Responsive & Mobile-Aware**  
  Scales gracefully across screen sizes with a mobile warning for optimal landscape usage.

- ✅ **Keyboard Input Support**  
  Type directly into the calculator using your physical keyboard for fast input.

- ✅ **Memory Operations**  
  Support for `M+`, `M-`, `MR`, and `MC`.

- ✅ **Toggle Radian/Degree Mode**  
  Easily switch between degrees and radians for trig calculations.

## 💻 Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| `0-9` | Input digits |
| `.` | Decimal point |
| `+ - * /` | Operators |
| `Enter` or `=` | Evaluate expression |
| `Backspace` | Delete last digit |
| `Escape` | Clear input |
| `(` and `)` | Parentheses |
| `r` / `d` | Toggle radians/degrees |

## ✨ Customization Ideas

You can extend this project further:
- Add **symbolic math** (e.g. simplify algebraic expressions)
- Include **graphing** with 2D/3D plots (e.g. using Plotly.js)
- Add **dark/light mode toggle**
- Display **calculation history**
- Support **touch gestures** for mobile
- Use **speech recognition** to input equations
